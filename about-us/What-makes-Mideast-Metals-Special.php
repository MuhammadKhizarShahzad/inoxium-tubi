            <h2>2. Standard Operating Procedures:</h2>
            <p class="text-sm">Right from the very first stage of procurement of the material, till the last stage of
                execution of
                the orders, there are certain standard operating procedures, developed with the experience of over
                125 years, followed conscientiously by the company, which makes the operation of the company almost
                flawless with optimum customer satisfaction level.</p>

            <h2>4. Quantity, Quality &amp; Price:</h2>
            <p class="text-sm">Purchase for the Mideast Metals has always been in Bulk. Quality matters and hence
                supplies are taken
                from only those Mills who have the reputation of producing the best material in one particular
                category, and only that particular material is purchased from that individual Mill, resulting in the
                ultimate collection of the very best materials from all around the world at one place. Mills, from
                Spain, Belgium, France, South Africa, Brazil, Japan, Taiwan and Korea, keep them on a steady stock,
                this in turn offers better rates, and therefore results in competitive prices supplemented with
                first-rate service which gives the company edge in the market.</p>
            <h2>5. Reliability:</h2>
            <p class="text-sm">Terms such as “Multi Million dollar business” &amp; “Stock holders of Stainless Steel”
                are not
                usually pinned with just any commonplace business or industry. These are terms which hold
                dependability and reliability. Mideast Metals is yet to have, at least one return of sale …. Such is
                the impeccability the management has on the business; Truly “A Stainless Name in Stainless Steel
                World”.</p>
            <h2>6. Swift Operation:</h2>
            <p class="text-sm">No order is too small or too big to be executed instantly. The daily delivery service
                throughout the
                7 emirates, scheduled twice a day, ensures and assures the customers that their requirement for any
                material is just a phone call away. First time in the Middle East, the up to date ETA (Estimated
                Time of Arrival) by SMS is sent to all customers, so that they are ready to offload the material
                when it arrives, thus resulting in more efficient operations both for customers and us.</p>
