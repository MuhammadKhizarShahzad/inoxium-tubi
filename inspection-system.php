          Tensile: To obtain the mechanical properties of finished tubes & pipes and testing for flaring, flange 
          test, flattening, reverse flatting, reverse bending.
        </li>
        <li>
          Flattening Test: This test is conducted to check the strength of the welded section subjecting it 
          to extreme compression stress.
        </li>
        <li>
          Flaring Test: The test is conducted to establish the forming behaviour of pipes & tubes which are 
          expanded to certain degree.
        </li>
        <li>
          Flange: The test is considered passed if the outer diameter of the flange reaches the value defined in 
          the specification standards without crack formations in the welded tube.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reverse Bend: To ensures full ductility of the tubes, as well as tests the weld and the base metal strength 
          by stretching the material to its physical endurance limit.
