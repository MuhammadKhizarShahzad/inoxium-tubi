      <h1>Benefits</h1>

      <h2>Corrosion resistance:</h2>
      <p class="text-sm">Lower alloyed grades resist corrosion in atmospheric and pure water environments, while
        high-alloyed grades can
        resist corrosion in most acids, alkaline solutions, and chlorine bearing environments, properties which are
        utilized in process plants.</p>
      <h2>Fire and heat resistance:</h2>
      <p class="text-sm">Special high chromium and nickel-alloyed grades resist scaling and retain strength at high
        temperatures.</p>
      <h2>Hygiene:</h2>
      <p class="text-sm">The easy cleaning ability of stainless makes it the first choice for strict hygiene conditions,
        such as
        hospitals, kitchens, abattoirs and other food processing plants.</p>
      <h2>Aesthetic appearance:</h2>
      <p class="text-sm">Stainless steel is available in many surface finishes. It is easily and simply maintained
        resulting in a high
        quality, pleasing appearance.</p>
      <h2>High and low temperature resistance:</h2>
      <p class="text-sm">Some grades will resist scaling and maintain high strength at very high temperatures, while
        others show
        exceptional toughness at cryogenic temperatures.</p>
      <h2>Strength-to-weight advantage:</h2>
      <p class="text-sm">The work-hardening property of austenitic grades, that results in a significant strengthening
        of
        the material
        from cold-working alone, and the high strength duplex grades, allow reduced material thickness over conventional
        grades, therefore cost savings.</p>
      <h2>Ease of fabrication:</h2>
      <p class="text-sm">The majority of stainless steels can be cut, welded, formed, machined and fabricated readily.
      </p>
      <h2>Impact resistance:</h2>
      <p class="text-sm">The austenitic microstructure of the 300 series provides high toughness, from elevated
        temperatures to far below
        freezing, making these steels particularly suited to cryogenic applications.</p>
      <h2>Environment Friendly:</h2>
      <p class="text-sm">In response to the growing awareness that our quality of life depends upon protection of our
        environment,
        consumers and regulators are directing their resources towards products less harmful to the environment. The
        challenge to engineers is clear: understand the “cradle to grave” characteristics of materials and make ever
        more
        satisfying products from ever more benign materials.<br> <br> In use stainless steel is durable and requires a
        minimum of maintenance, outlasting many competing products and eliminating requirements for additional
        potentially
        hazardous materials such as paint, fire protective coatings, cleaners and solvents.<br> <br> Stainless steel is
        a
        valuable scrap material. It is 100% recyclable and a preferred raw material input by steel makers. Stainless
        steel
        production incorporates high levels of scrap use (as high as 80% of charged materials will be scrap stainless
        steel).<br> <br> New stainless steel comprises at least 50% recycled stainless steel product and more than half
        the stainless steel produced today has already been another useful stainless steel product in the past. Even
        beer
        kegs wear out eventually. Power is expensive and modern stainless mills operate close to the theoretical
        minimum.<br> <br> Despite the very high recycling of old stainless steel products, some stainless steel will
        find
        its way to landfills or other disposal sites. In these circumstances no detrimental effect to soil or ground
        water
        is expected.</p>
      <h2>Long term value:</h2>
      <p class="text-sm">When the total life cycle costs are considered, stainless is often the least expensive material
        option.</p>
      <h2>Cycle of Stainless Steel:</h2>
      <p class="text-sm">To ensure a high quality of life, the materials that we use as consumers and manufacturers
        should
        meet not only
        technical performance standards, but have a Long Service Life, be Usable in a Great Number of Applications, and
        be
        Environmentally Friendly. Once their service is complete, they should be 100% Recyclable, thereby completing the
        life cycle to be used once again. Stainless Steel is such a material.<br> <br> The longevity of stainless is the
        result of the alloying composition and, therefore, it has a natural corrosion resistance. Nothing is applied to
        the surface that could add additional material to the environment. It does not need additional systems to
        protect
        the base metal, the metal itself will last. Stainless steel needs less maintenance and its hygienic qualities
        means that we do not have to use harsh cleaners to get a clean surface. There is little or nothing to dump into
        the drain that could have an environmental impact.<br> <br> Stainless steel products complete their service
        life.
        There is less concern about disposal since this material is 100% recyclable. In fact, over 50% of new stainless
        steel comes from old re-melted stainless steel scrap, thereby completing the full life cycle.<br> <br>
