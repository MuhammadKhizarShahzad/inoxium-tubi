          Tensile: To obtain the mechanical properties of finished tubes & pipes and testing for flaring, flange 
          test, flattening, reverse flatting, reverse bending.

        <li>
          Flattening Test: This test is conducted to check the strength of the welded section subjecting it 
          to extreme compression stress.
        </li>
        <li>
          Flaring Test: The test is conducted to establish the forming behaviour of pipes & tubes which are 
          expanded to certain degree.
        </li>
        <li>
          Flange: The test is considered passed if the outer diameter of the flange reaches the value defined in 
          the specification standards without crack formations in the welded tube.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reverse Bend: To ensures full ductility of the tubes, as well as tests the weld and the base metal strength 
          by stretching the material to its physical endurance limit.

      Hardness Test:
      <p class="font-normal">
        The hardness is the ability of a material to resist the pressing of a harder material into its surface. 
        According to different test methods and adaptation range, pipe hardness has different units, brinell hardness 
        is one of them.

      Leak Test:

        Hydrostatic: Hydro Testing – SS Straight Tubes and Pipes – 100% hydrostatic testing is carried out according 
        to ASTM A450 & 530 & ASTM –A1016 norms to check tubes for leakage. Hydrotesting of pipes, pipelines and vessel 
        is performed to expose defective material that have missed prior detection, ensure that any remaining 
        defective are insignificant enough to allow operation at design pressures, expose possible leaks
        and serve as a final validation of the insight of the constructed system.
