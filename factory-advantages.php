      <p><strong> <br>MIDEAST METALS PRECISION BLANKING LINE WITH STRETCHER LEVELER</strong></p>
      <p>Bringing for the first time, the Ultimate American technology in coil processing to produce Laser flat sheets
        in the continent Asia, the first ever Stainless steel STRETCHER LEVELER in Asia which can process coils up to
        8mm thickness. For the population of more than 4 billion across 50 countries, there is only one STRETCHER
        LEVELER giving laser flat sheets which stay flat even after laser cutting, notching, punching, or subsequent
        shearing operations.The Stretcher Leveler stretches the material sufficiently to exceed the yield point in all
        the fibers of the strip from top to bottom and from edge to edge thus equalizing internal trapped stresses
        throughout the material.</p>
      <p><br>How “level” is your material? How confident are you that your material will stay flat after you laser cut,
        shear, or punch it? Just because material looks flat, it does not mean it will stay that way. Due to trapped
        internal stresses, once material is cut, it can spring back. Stretcher leveling produces the flattest, most
        stable material possible, virtually independent of incoming strip shape and severity. In a head to head
        comparison, stretch leveling will produce better results than a Temper Mill and will significantly outperform
        any other type of leveling process. Because stretch leveling exceeds the yield in all of the material top to
        bottom and side to side, the process produces flat material that is significantly more stable than any other
        product.</p>
      <p><br><strong>KEY FEATURES OF MIDEAST METALS STRETCHER LEVELER<br></strong>• Stretcher Leveler produces flat
        material that stays flat.<br>• Equalized stresses eliminate spring back.<br>• Process is not sensitive to
        incoming shape.<br>• Reduces percentage of scrap loss.<br>• Process will not change mechanical properties.
